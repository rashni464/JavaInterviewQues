What is Encapsulation?
a) the process which private variables and public methods are integrated together.

Why Java is called platform-independent?
Java is called platform-independent because the byte code generated by the JDK (Java Development Kit) 
can be executed by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) on any platform regardless of the operating system.

Why Java is not entirely object-oriented?
Java is not entirely object-oriented since it uses eight primitive data types that are not objects: boolean,
byte, char, int, float, double, long, and short.

Q)What is the main difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
A) JDK (Java Development Kit) is for development, JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is for running Java applications, and JVM 
(Java Virtual Machine) is an execution environment for running Java bytecode.

Q)Explain the main features of Java.
A)Object-oriented, Platform-independent, Simple, Secure, Portable, Robust, Multithreaded, High Performance, Distributed.

Q) Why java is Rubost?
A)Java is robust because it utilizes strong memory management.There is automatic garbage collection in Java which runs
on the Java Virtual Machine to eliminate objects which are not being accepted by a Java application anymore.

Q)What is multithreading in java?
A)Multithreading is a programming concept in which the application can create a small unit of tasks to execute in parallel.
If you are working on a computer, it runs multiple applications and allocates processing power to them. A simple program runs
in sequence and the code statements execute one by one. Example( if your are running a code in VS when you type a static it will
pop up with all the static words and sametime it willshow if you have any error. That is done by multi threading).

q)3. Difference between Heap and Stack Memory in java. And how java utilizes this.
Stack memory is the portion of memory that was assigned to every individual program. And it was fixed. On the other hand, Heap memory
is the portion that was not allocated to the java program but it will be available for use by the java program when it is required,
mostly during the runtime of the program.

Q) Pointers are used in C/ C++. Why does Java not make use of pointers?
Pointers are quite complicated and unsafe to use by beginner programmers. Java focuses on code simplicity, and the 
usage of pointers can make it challenging. Moreover, security is also compromised if pointers are used because the users can directly 
access memory with the help of pointers Moreover, the usage of pointers can make the procedure of garbage collection quite slow and
erroneous.

7. What do you understand by an instance variable and a local variable?
A) Instance variables are those variables that are accessible by all the methods in the class. They are declared outside the methods and 
inside the class. 
Local variables are those variables present within a block, function, or constructor and can be accessed only inside them. The utilization 
of the variable is restricted to the block scope.

8)What are the default values assigned to variables and instances in java?
There are no default values assigned to the variables in java. We need to initialize the value before using it. Otherwise,
it will throw a compilation error of (Variable might not be initialized). 
But for instance, if we create the object, then the default value will be initialized by the default constructor 
depending on the data type. 

9) What do you mean by data encapsulation?
Data Encapsulation is an Object-Oriented Programming concept of hiding the data attributes and their behaviours.We 
are binding the data with the methods. only way we can use the data is by using methods.Outside world cannot use it directly.
we are encapsulationg data and methods.

10)What is a singleton in Java?
A singleton class in Java ensures only one instance of itself exists. To make one, create a class with a private static instance 
variable and a private constructor. Then, provide a public static method to access the instance. This method checks if the instance
exists; if not, it creates one

11) what is rest api?
A) rest api is used to transfer the data from domain to another domain via http protacol.

12) difference between SOAP and rest?
A) Soap is used to transfer data from one domain to other when application is in XML based.
Rest api is used to transfer the data from domain to another domain via http protacol when application is in xml, json and test..

13) What is XML?
a) when we write a angular code and in backend if we write java then there should be common language to communicate 
so they use Xml. But xml is very complex so now a days they are using JSON as common language.
