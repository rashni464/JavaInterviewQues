Q) how production support works?
A) Once a developer write the code and commit it the build get runs in the jenkins which checks all the test cases, build etc  after all the stages passes get deployed in 
the dev with the new version number.
2: Once the testing is done we will go to UCD and with the same version we deploy that in sit and uat envirnoments.
3: At the end in the pcf we will deploy for production. In wells we use PCF but other company they  use Kubernates. once it get deployed
in the kubernetics the local server level logs run in the Kubernetis. and to check all the logs there is a tool named datadoc or splunk
which has all the logs. ( How the applcation logs can be seen in the datadoc: datadoc have a jar that will be added in te java 
program when the aplication got deployed and runs on the server then that logs show up in the datadoc)
4: The developer go in to the datadoc and check the logs based on that if he find any issue he works.

Q) How a  developer solves the production issues?
A) First he goes and check the splunk or datadoc for logs.
secondly he checks weather the server is up or down in the pcf
Thridly hewe check any thrid party servers have any issue or not because most of our servers depends on otherservers aswell.
